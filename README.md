# 🏥 Provider Data Cleaner  
### Built for EY Hackathon 2025-26 🚀  

An AI-powered healthcare data cleaning application designed to standardize, validate, and enhance provider datasets with intelligent automation.

This project was built during the **EY Hackathon 2026** to solve a real-world problem: cleaning messy healthcare provider data efficiently and accurately.

---

## ✨ Problem Statement

Healthcare provider datasets often contain:
- Inconsistent phone number formats  
- Invalid or malformed email addresses  
- Incomplete or low-quality addresses  
- Unstructured data entries  

Manual cleaning is time-consuming and error-prone.

This tool automates validation, standardization, and quality scoring of provider data.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 📞 Phone Number Standardization (India Focused)
- Converts numbers to standard +91XXXXXXXXXX format
- Handles:
  - 10-digit numbers  
  - 11-digit numbers (starting with 0)  
  - 12-digit numbers (starting with 91)  
- Flags invalid entries  

Example:
9876543210   → +919876543210  
09876543210  → +919876543210  
919876543210 → +919876543210

### 📧 Email Validation & Cleaning
- Removes extra whitespace  
- Fixes multiple @ symbols  
- Removes consecutive dots  
- Validates proper email format  

Example:
test@@mail..com → test@mail.com

### 📍 Intelligent Address Quality Scoring

Addresses are scored out of 100 based on:

- Street Number (25)
- Street Type (25)
- ZIP Code (20)
- City Name (30)

Rating System:
- Excellent (90–100)
- Good (70–89)
- Fair (50–69)
- Poor (30–49)
- Invalid (0–29)

For valid addresses, approximate India-based coordinates are generated:
- Latitude range: 8°N – 35°N  
- Longitude range: 68°E – 97°E
