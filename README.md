# 🏥 Provider Data Cleaner  
### Built for EY Hackathon 2026 🚀  

An AI-powered healthcare data cleaning application designed to standardize, validate, and enhance provider datasets with intelligent automation.

This project was built during the **EY Hackathon 2026** to solve a real-world problem: cleaning messy healthcare provider data efficiently and accurately.

---

## ✨ Problem Statement

Healthcare provider datasets often contain:
- Inconsistent phone number formats  
- Invalid or malformed email addresses  
- Incomplete or low-quality addresses  
- Unstructured data entries  

Manual cleaning is time-consuming and error-prone.

This tool automates validation, standardization, and quality scoring of provider data.

### 📍 Intelligent Address Quality Scoring

Addresses are scored out of 100 based on:

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Street Number | 25 |
| Street Type | 25 |
| ZIP Code | 20 |
| City Name | 30 |

Rating System:
- ⭐ Excellent (90–100)
- ✅ Good (70–89)
- ⚠️ Fair (50–69)
- ❌ Poor (30–49)
- 🚫 Invalid (0–29)

For valid addresses, approximate India-based coordinates are generated:
- Latitude range: 8°N – 35°N  
- Longitude range: 68°E – 97°E
